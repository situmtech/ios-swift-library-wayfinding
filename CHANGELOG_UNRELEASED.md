## [0.1.16] - 2021-11-30

###Â Fixed
* Previously when a building was first shown in the app, the default floor that appeared in the screen was the highest floor. Now this was changed to be the lowest floor

### Added
* Added methods in LibrarySettings and SitumMapView to set the user marker from a local asset.
* Now the user position error range circle gets its color from the dashboard when the option useDashboardTheme is set to true. The same applies to the navigation path color.
