### Changed:
* Navigation UI has been redesigned with aesthetic improvements and better and more clear information about the route
* Changes in GoogleMaps styles to adjust the colors and lightness of some cartographic elements.
* Changes in GoogleMaps styles to hide GoogleMaps POI names.
* Changed the behaviour of the module when setShowTextPois is not set. Now the default value is false so only the POI icons whithout its name will appear on the map.

### Fixed:
* Fixed a bug detected in naviagation mode when the user goes outside the route. In previous versions while the user 
was outside the route the user location was not updated.
