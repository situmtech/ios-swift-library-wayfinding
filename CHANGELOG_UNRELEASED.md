### Changed
-  Added floor change icons in the route path to indicate when a change of floor has to be made
- Added support to customize minZoom and maxZoom on the map. With this feature as a developer you can provide values that configure the minimum and maximum value of zoom the map will allow the user to set. Since the base map depends on GoogleMaps, you can see more information regarding the zoom parameter on https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/views#zoom for Android and https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/views#zoom for iOS.
